---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Google Apps Script

1. **Open your Google Sheet**
   - Go to Extensions → Apps Script

2. **Copy the fixed script**
   - Copy ALL content from `google-apps-script/guest-management.js`
   - Paste into Apps Script editor
   - Save (Ctrl+S)

3. **Initialize the sheet**
   ```javascript
   // Run this function first:
   initializeGuestSheet()
   ```

4. **Add sample data (optional)**
   ```javascript
   // Run this to test:
   addSampleGuests()
   ```

5. **Deploy as Web App**
   - Click Deploy → New deployment
   - Select "Web app"
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
   - Click Deploy
   - **COPY THE WEB APP URL** ⚠️

### Step 2: Update API URL

**Option A: Direct in Code**

Open `/app/api/guests/route.ts` and update line 6:

```typescript
const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_NEW_WEB_APP_URL_HERE'
```

**Option B: Environment Variable (Recommended)**

Create/update `.env.local`:

```env
GUEST_MANAGEMENT_API_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec
```

Then update route.ts:
```typescript
const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = process.env.GUEST_MANAGEMENT_API_URL || ''
```

## 📊 What Your Google Sheet Looks Like Now

After initialization, your "Guests" sheet will have these columns:

| ID | Name | Role | Email | Contact | Message | AllowedGuests | Companions (JSON) | TableNumber | IsVip | Status | AddedBy | CreatedAt | UpdatedAt |
|----|------|------|-------|---------|---------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| uuid | John Smith | Friend | john@... | +123... | Message | 3 | [{"name":"Jane"...}] | T1 | TRUE | confirmed | Groom | 2025-12-19... | 2025-12-19... |

## 🔄 Migration from Old Data

If you have existing guests in the old format, use the migration helper:

```javascript
// In Apps Script, run these in order:
1. prepareForMigration()     // Backup & prepare
2. previewMigration()         // See what will migrate
3. migrateGuestsToNewSystem() // Do the migration
4. verifyMigration()          // Check results
```

After migration, you'll need to manually:
- Fill in companion names (they'll be empty placeholders)
- Update roles from default "Guest"
- Mark VIP guests
- Assign table numbers
- Add phone numbers if available
